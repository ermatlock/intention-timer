# Intention Timer
### Overview

_This is our group project called Intention Timer. The application is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS._
   - The application provides the user with three categories from which they can then select.
   - Next, the user can then add their own description of the activity they want to accomplish.
    - Finally, the user can input both the minutes and seconds they wish to dedicate towards their activity.

### Home Page

Immediately the user is prompted with three category options: study, exercise, and meditate. From there, the user moves to the description field to specify what they would like to accomplish during this time. Additionally, the user inputs the number of minutes and seconds in the respective fields. Once all fields have been completed, the user clicks the 'Start Activity' button. All fields must be filled out in order to move on to the timer page, otherwise an error is shown depending on which field is left incomplete.
